spec:
  # Specifies the name of the ClusterDefinition to use when creating a Cluster.
  clusterDefinitionRef: elasticsearch
  # Specifies the elasticSearch cluster topology defined in ClusterDefinition.Spec.topologies, support single-node or multi-node.
  # - `single-node`: single elasticSearch instance
  # - `multi-node`: elasticSearch cluster with master,data,ingest and transform instance
  topology: single-node
  # Specifies the behavior when a Cluster is deleted.
  # - `DoNotTerminate`: Prevents deletion of the Cluster. This policy ensures that all resources remain intact.
  # - `Halt`: Deletes Cluster resources like Pods and Services but retains Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing for data preservation while stopping other operations.
  # - `Delete`: Extends the `Halt` policy by also removing PVCs, leading to a thorough cleanup while removing all persistent data.
  # - `WipeOut`: An aggressive policy that deletes all Cluster resources, including volume snapshots and backups in external storage. This results in complete data removal and should be used cautiously, primarily in non-production environments to avoid irreversible data loss.
  terminationPolicy: Delete
  # Specifies a list of ClusterComponentSpec objects used to define the individual components that make up a Cluster.
